# AMS-1: American Adult Male Standard

**Status:** Draft  
An open standard for low-friction, socially coherent adult male dress.

## Purpose

AMS-1 defines a baseline system of male public presentation that:

- Minimizes daily decision fatigue  
- Signals social participation  
- Scales across social and professional contexts  

This document is written in the format of a technical standard. It is partly serious, partly cultural commentary, and fully open to revision.

## Scope

This is a **baseline** system. Personal style is optional and layered on top.

The goal is not fashion performance, but clear, consistent signaling of adulthood, social awareness, and shared norms.

## Structure

- **Operational Contexts** define when and why clothing changes
- **Jackets and Shoes** form the structural core of male presentation
- **The Closet** defines interoperable wardrobe components
- **Protocol** maps clothing to context
- **Grooming** and **Overdressing** define behavioral standards

## Visual Reference
