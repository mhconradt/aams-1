# **AAMS-1: American Adult Male Standard — Clothing Protocol**

**Status:** Draft
 **Scope:** Everyday dress for adult men in public life
 **Goal:** Provide a stable, low-decision framework that signals adulthood, social awareness, and baseline competence without requiring fashion hobbyism.

This document defines a default male clothing system. Personal style is optional and layered on top of this baseline.

### Visual Companion

This document defines the rules and structure of the system.  
For practical examples of outfits, garments, and silhouettes, see:

**[Visual Examples →](visual-examples.md)**

The visual guide is illustrative, not prescriptive, and exists to clarify the intent of the protocol.

------

## **2. Operational Contexts**

All clothing decisions are determined by context level.

### **2.1 Athletic**

Gym sessions, sports, physical training.
 Performance and function override presentation.

### **2.2 Chill**

Private homes, backyard gatherings, lounging, and environments with high social familiarity.
 Comfort is prioritized. Public signaling is not required.

### **2.3 Casual**

The baseline for adult public life.
 Errands, everyday social life, personal activities, most parties, traveling, and general public presence.

This is the standard operating level for an adult man outside specialized contexts.

### **2.4 Labor**

Manual or skilled physical work such as carpentry, plumbing, construction, and mechanical tasks.

### **2.5 Elevate**

Dates, dinners, evening social events, travel, cocktail environments, fundraisers, and any venue where visible effort is socially rewarded.

Signal: The social setting is heightened, and you are a willing participant in elevating that setting both out of respect for others in your party and others at the venue.

- When all men present are turned out well, it creates a heightened context for everyone present. Men should be cognizant that in **Elevate** settings, anyone who defects from that elevated setting degrades the environment for everyone present. It may be rebellious to do so, but it is also anti-social.

### **2.6 Authority**

Professional and leadership environments where competence, structure, and credibility must be signaled. Executives.

Signal: Responsibility, decision-making, and reliability.

### **2.7 Formal**

Ceremonial and traditional formalwear contexts.
 Black tie, white tie, and established formal dress codes apply.

------

## **3. Jackets and shoes**

The core idea of the protocol is that jackets and shoes are the foundation of expected male attire. They are the primary signaling elements of adulthood and social awareness.

### **3.1 Jackets**

Jackets, as in blazers and/or sports coats, create structure and define the adult silhouette. We do not mean leather jackets, jean jackets, or other casual outerwear in this section.

Men should own:

- One light jacket for warm weather and transitional use
- One cool or cold jacket suitable for fall and winter layering

**Colors:** navy, charcoal, black, muted earth tones
 **Summer options:** stone, sand, off-white linen

### **3.2 Shoes**

Shoes anchor formality and communicate effort.

Men should maintain:

- A minimal leather shoe for daily adult wear
- A casual leather shoe or boot
- Athletic footwear for **Athletic** contexts only

Cleaner shoes read as more formal. Leather tones should be coordinated with belts and watch straps when practical.

------

## **4. The closet**

These are the baseline garments that support the jacket-and-shoe system.

Garments in the baseline wardrobe should be interoperable. Most tops should work with most trousers without additional coordination decisions. This is why the system relies on restrained, neutral colors.

### **4.1 Sweaters and sweatshirts**

Men should own:

- One light wool sweater
- One heavy wool sweater
- A sweater vest (optional but encouraged)

**Colors:** navy, gray, charcoal, muted blues
 **Patterns:** solid preferred, minimal patterns acceptable

Hoodies and sweatshirts are limited to **Chill** contexts and should not be worn with leather shoes.

### **4.2 Shirts**

Men should own a rotation of:

- Plain t-shirts
- Polos or knit shirts
- Long-sleeve button-up shirts, single color with no chest pockets

**Colors:** white, off-white, light blue, muted tones
 Graphics should be minimal and reserved for **Chill** settings.

### **4.3 Trousers**

Men should maintain:

- Dark, clean jeans
- Casual slacks
- Structured slacks or wool trousers

Distressing, rips, and extreme washes fall outside the baseline.

**Pant length:**
 Trousers should lightly rest on shoes without stacking excessively.

### **4.4 Denim guidance**

Jeans should rest cleanly on the shoes, with the back covering most of the heel and minimal stacking. Rolling denim to reach that length is allowed.

Straight leg and boot cut jeans are timeless cuts. Relaxed or athletic fit works for men who need more room.

Skinny jeans are generally discouraged outside of narrow subcultural aesthetics.

### **4.5 Color protocol**

The system relies on a restrained palette.

**Base colors:** navy, charcoal, black, white, off-white, muted blues and grays
 **Seasonal lightening:** sand, stone, soft earth tones in warm weather
 **Patterns:** restrained heritage patterns such as tweed or herringbone

### **4.6 Color accent mechanisms**

Optional small expressions of color may come from:

- Pocket squares
- Ties
- Enamel pins (one or two maximum)
- Socks
- Scarves

### **4.7 Jewelry and accessories**

The guideline on jewelry is that less is more. It's more about what is discouraged rather than encouraged.

Men who want the simplest closet possible should decide whether they want to err on the side of black or brown leather. To keep it simple, choose one. Black reads more sophisticated. Brown reads warmer.

If both colors are owned, belts should match the shoes. If only one color family is owned, only one belt is needed.

The patina of the belt should roughly match the patina of the shoes. Shiny shoes pair with shinier belts. Matte shoes pair with matte belts.

- Watches
- Wedding band
- Cufflinks encouraged in **Elevate**, **Authority**, or **Formal** settings
- Necklaces under clothing
- Visible chains limited to **Chill** contexts

### **4.8 Coats and winter wear**

- Coats should be purchased with the expectation that they will accommodate a jacket
- Coats should have sufficient length to cover a jacket
- Coats should be promptly set aside once indoors
- Winter boots, scarves, and winter hats depend on geography, but low levels of design and color are encouraged
- In wet climates, a simple rain shell in a neutral color should be included

### **4.9 Western**

- Cowboy boots, bolo ties and western style belts are acceptable substitutes at all levels in **Casual**, **Elevate**, **Authority**, and **Formal**, as appropriate
- There is no need to starch denim

### **4.10 Hats**

Hats are in flux. It's a personal decision.

------

## **5. Protocol**

This section applies the wardrobe system to operational contexts.

### **5.1 Athletic**

Athletic footwear and technical garments.
 Shorts.

### **5.2 Chill**

Sneakers.
 T-shirts, polos, hoodies, sweatshirts.
 Jeans of any quality.
 Plain shorts acceptable but cargo shorts are discouraged.
 Leather jackets, jean jackets, golf jackets, and similar casual outerwear.
 No structured jacket.

### **5.3 Casual**

Jacket.
 Leather shoes or minimalist sneakers.
 Polo, knit shirt, plain t-shirt or simple button-up.
 Dark jeans or casual slacks.
 Sweaters or sweater vests depending on weather.

### **5.4 Labor**

Task-appropriate workwear.
 Sneakers or work boots.

**Transition rule:**
 Upon completion of work, men should change from labor attire into casual attire before re-entering social or public settings.

Labor clothing is task-specific, not a social uniform.

### **5.5 Elevate**

Jacket.
 Leather dress shoes, generally black.
 Button-up shirt or refined knit.
 Slacks or dark jeans.
 Optional color accents.
 Sweaters or sweater vests depending on weather.

### **5.6 Authority**

Structured jacket.
 Leather shoes.
 Button-up shirt.
 Slacks or wool trousers.
 Tie or bow-tie. Simple designs always. Reps. Dots. Checks. Paisleys. No more than three colors.
 Or wear a suit.
 Sweater vests or dress vests as needed.

### **5.7 Formal**

Follow established formalwear standards of the event.

------

## **6. Grooming and presentation standards**

Clothing compliance is incomplete without grooming compliance.

### **6.1 Hair**

Hair should appear intentional, with a visible cut or maintained shape.

### **6.2 Facial hair**

Beards and stubble should be trimmed and shaped.

### **6.3 General hygiene**

- Clean nails
- Maintained skin
- Breath control
- No visible garment staining or odor
- Men should brush their teeth at least every morning and every night

### **6.4 Fragrance**

Cologne should be minimal. Two sprays maximum. Apply to skin, not clothing. Consult trusted women in your life on selection and volume. Fragrance should be discovered, not announced.

------

## **7. Shopping**

The expense or brand signaling of clothing is to be discouraged. It is not important if a man's jacket comes from Saks 5th Avenue or J.C. Penney's in this protocol. What matters is that a man is that he is choosing to signal responsibility and buy-in to expectations of sharing a part of the commonweal.

That said, brands that emphasize shopping for staples, low turnover in closets should be encouraged. Spending slightly more because something is built to last (not because it signals affluence) should be encouraged.

------

## **8. Overdressing principle**

Within this system, mild overdressing is not a social error.

If others appear underdressed and you appear composed, structured, and adult, this is considered successful compliance with the protocol.

Slight elevation signals competence. Sloppiness does not signal approachability.

------

## **9. Compliance principle**

This system is not about fashion performance. It is about reliable adulthood signaling with minimal effort.

When uncertain:

- Wear the jacket
- Wear leather shoes with some valence of dressiness
- Keep colors simple
- Low logo levels, low design levels

Men who want to dress for personal expression are encouraged to do so. The protocol is not about conformity, it's about elevating men in order to clearly and succinctly signal which men are bought into sharing and building their society and bought into all the responsbilities that entails.
